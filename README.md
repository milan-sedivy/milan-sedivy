## Hi there 👋 I'm Milan

I guess my biggest hobbies are applied mathematics and programming, it's always fun to see a theoretical concept being applied to a real problem (and seeing it work!). :)

Apart from that I like soldering, carpentry, baking sourdough bread and growing chilli peppers. 

I'm currently building / experimenting with a custom ARM homelab. I started this project out of curiosity and personal need as I wanted extra HW resources, but didn't want to upgrade my PC.
After stumbling upon OrangePi Zero 3 I was more than excited as for roughly USD 25 (before memory chip shortage) I could get:
- 4GB of RAM
- 4 CPUs with 1.5GHz clockspeed
- 1 GPU (OpenGL ES 1.0/2.0/3.2, OpenCL 2.0, and Vulkan 1.1 support)

All of which required at most 3W of power to run (without peripherals).

It's still in its infancy as I'm hoping to try and get more of them for a cheaper price.
